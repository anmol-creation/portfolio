## ⚙️ Installation & Setup (Local Development)

To run this project locally, you'll need Node.js installed on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd anmolcreations
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Cloudinary keys:

    ```env
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
    ```

4.  **Fetch Gallery Data:**
    Run the update script to fetch the latest images from Cloudinary and generate the `data/sketches.json` file:
    ```bash
    npm run update-gallery
    ```

5.  **View the Site:**
    Since this is a static site, you can use any static file server. For example:
    - If using **VS Code**, use the "Live Server" extension.
    - Or use python: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
    - Or simply open `index.html` in your browser (though some features may require a server).

## 🔄 Automatic Updates (GitHub Actions)

This repository includes a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/update-gallery.yml`) that automatically updates the gallery.

- **Schedule:** Runs automatically every 6 hours.
- **Trigger:** Also runs when you push changes to the `main` branch.
- **Process:** It fetches the latest list of images from the 'Sketches' folder in Cloudinary and commits a new `data/sketches.json` file to the repository.

To enable this, you must add your Cloudinary keys to your repository's **GitHub Secrets**:
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
2.  Add the following secrets:
    - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
    - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
    - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

## 🔒 Security

API keys are **never** exposed to the frontend. They are used only by the build script (running locally or in GitHub Actions) to generate a static JSON file. The frontend only consumes this public JSON file.
